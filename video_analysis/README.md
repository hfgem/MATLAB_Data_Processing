# Video Analysis

Author: Hannah Germaine

Summary: This collection of programs is dedicated to analysis of imaging data of cell activation. The program "cell_activation_video_generation.m" simply creates an example grayscale video of cell response, and the program "video_analysis.m" performs a very basic analysis of the grayscale video. These programs were meant as an exercise in working with videos and capturing masic statistics from the data (stored in the structure "cell_data").
